# __Soybean Breeders Worshop__

__KEYNOTE SPEAKER:Dr. Grover Shannon__
  - Offensive Breeding: example Yield; use checks of variteies that are used by farmers
  - Defensive Breeding: Disease and Pest reistance
  - Genetic Diversity: no using our germplasm to the full potential
  - [Research paper](https://bmcplantbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2229-10-195)
 
__William Singer__:AAAS Science and Technology Policy Fellow, USDA- Office of the Chief Scientist
  - Information; partmnership; strategic planning; coordination; scientific integrity, and key performance indicators
  - Plant Breeding Working Group and Roadmap (PBWG)
 
__Michael Loh__
  - Plant based food
  - Food traits for TUFO: High protein levels large and uniforn seed
  - Food traits for MISO: High sugar; Good water intake
  - Food traits for SoyMilk: Medium protien

### Abiotic Stress - Drought

__Larry Purcell: Nitrogen fixation: What is it good for? (1) Yield (2) Protein__

  - "Speed Breeding"
using growth chamber Planting to R1 26+/-2.4 days; Planting R1-R7 56
  - [Research paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00122-010-1493-4)
  - Oil concentration not affected by N treatment w/ Nod 
  - Appling that much N is not economical 
  - Oil concentratoin increase by N treatment w/o Nod
  - Non-nodule Williams82 is resesive rj5 and rj6 
  - Mapping rj5 and rj6
  - Quantifying N2 fixation is critcial for improvoing seed protein and yield 
  - High yielding, non-nods for appropriate materity are essential

  - Genetic varibaility with irrigated vs. dryland with soybean - drought stress reduced the pod and seed set.
      * Irrigated had higher leaf transportation 
      * Much lower yield in drylan - noticed pollen grains viabilty lowered due to stress and lower Carbon in the pollen
  - Important traits for Screening: using sensors, campony measurements, imaging and theormal sensors. 
  - Pollen Assay - to measure the pollen viviablity 
  - Potential Traits for High TGemperature (Heat) Stress
      * Reproductive success, seed set, seed numbers
      * Favorable Respiration Increase Biomass
      * Grain Filling duration and Grain Filling Rate
      * Increased Membrance Stability 
      * Canopy Temperature Depression 
 - Potential Traits for Drought stress
      * Stay Green 
      * Limited transpiration (water savings in early season)
      * Water usage
  - Genetic varibility in current breeding lines is limited and need to explore and screen the germplasm include wild

  - The water cycle; water vaper. VPD=Vapor %
  - [Climatic forcing for recent significant terrestrial drying and wetting](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0309170819302787)
  - [Systemic effects of rising atmospheric vapor pressure deficit on plant physiology and productivity](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gcb.15548)
  - Hypothesis: well-watered, increase VPD and increase nitrogen fixation
