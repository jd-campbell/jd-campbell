__Soybean Genomics Workshop__

3. Aaron Lorenz: Developing Resources to advance genetic prediction soybean 

  * Using North Uniform Soybean Trail (NUST) data and it is available on [SoyBase.org](SoyBase.og) and [SoybeanBase] (https://soybeanbase.breedinginsight.net). 
  * For breeders Genomic selection (GS) can fast forward the breeding pipeline. GS saves: 4 years saved in parent section; 2 years saved in variety releases; Saves over $70,000 in land use.
  * Genomic prediction accuracy in SoyNAM variey from 20% to 50%. Genomic selection performs as effectively as phenotypic selection for increasing seed yield in soybean. [Research paper](https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/tpg2.20285)
  * Challenges for academic breeding programs: Cost of genotyping; Turnaround time and Human resources (PostDocs and Graduate students + Temporary workers); Risk of failure. 
  * Efforts to help the challenges -> Database development and training material
  
  * [SOYGEN](https://ncsrp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/NCSRP-2021-Genetic-Gain.pdf): Science Optimized Yield Gains across ENvironments
  * SOYGEN using the NUST past and present data - again available on both [SoyBase.org](SoyBase.og) and [SoybeanBase] (https://soybeanbase.breedinginsight.net). 
  * Dara from NUST is publicly available and the phenotypic data is available on [SoyBase](https://soybase.org/ncsrp/queryportal/)

4. Katy Martin Rainey: Genetic Improvement of Complex Traits in Soybean: Insights into Selection for Yield, Maturity and Seed Quality

  * Using the well documented public #soybean resources at [SoyBase.org](SoyBase.org) including the SoySNP50K and SoyNAM.
  * Impact of increased sucrose content on overall seed quality in soybean Increasing sucrose content would likely lead to protein content sacrifices. Paper in review/No pre-print.

5. Yong-Qiang (Charles) An:  Toward Understanding Molecular Basis of Seed Protein and Oil in Soybean Domestication and Improvement through an Integrative Data Driven Approach

  * Introgression and/or improvements combination to increase desired traits. Embracing the BigData and integrative approach for breeding (alleles, functional markers, Germplasm) Focusing on soybean germplasm diversity
  * Multiple studies still finding seed quality QTLs: 
  1. POWR1 (Protein, Oil, Weight, Regulator 1) is a domestication gene pleiotropically regulating seed quality and yield in soybean [Research paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-30314-7)
  2. Fine mapping and cloning of the major seed protein quantitative trait loci on soybean chromosome 20 [Research paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34978122/)
