### __Soybean Genomics Workshop__

1. Jianxin Ma: Rapid Evolution of Disease Resistance Genes in Soybean

  * Soybean rot and stem rot causes an annual yield loss of $250 million USD and more than 1 million USD worldwide. Important to identify novel Rps because a number of known Rps genes have become partially effective or completely ineffective.
  * Rps1-k has lost resistance to the pathogen in Indiana. Using landrace #soybean for new source for resistance and IDed over 100 varieties that are resistance. And 23 soybean landraces found to be resistant to multiple pathogens.
  * PI 594527 carries an excellent resistance to P. sojae Mapped to Gm07 on Wm82. [Research paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26660465/)

2. Kyung Do Kim: Development of Molecular Marker Linked to White Soybean Cyst Nematode (Heterodera sojae) Resistance in Soybean

  * GWAS studies for resistant to new cyst nematode species H. sojae (WSCN) in soybean - which is found in Korea, Japan and China. But H. glycine (SCN) is a problem around the world. [Research paper](https://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/full/10.1094/PHP-10-20-0094-BR)
  * Expansion of WSCN in Korea [Research paper](https://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/full/10.1094/PDIS-09-19-1932-SC)
  * Management of SCN by creating new resistance varieties [News Report](https://crops.extension.iastate.edu/cropnews/2021/10/scn-resistant-soybean-varieties-iowa-2022)
  * For WSCN GWAS study used the Koran core soybean collection. GWAS results showed 9 significant peaks 
6 significant SNPs found on Gm01 and candidate genes within Gm01 region expression was found in the roots. This could be a new resistance source 3 significant SNPs also found in the Rgh1 region on Gm18 [Research paper](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0224074)

3. Aaron Lorenz: Developing Resources to advance genetic prediction soybean 

  * Using North Uniform Soybean Trail (NUST) data and it is available on [SoyBase.org](SoyBase.og) and [SoybeanBase] (https://soybeanbase.breedinginsight.net). 
  * For breeders Genomic selection (GS) can fast forward the breeding pipeline. GS saves: 4 years saved in parent section; 2 years saved in variety releases; Saves over $70,000 in land use.
  * Genomic prediction accuracy in SoyNAM variey from 20% to 50%. Genomic selection performs as effectively as phenotypic selection for increasing seed yield in soybean. [Research paper](https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/tpg2.20285)
  * Challenges for academic breeding programs: Cost of genotyping; Turnaround time and Human resources (PostDocs and Graduate students + Temporary workers); Risk of failure. 
  * Efforts to help the challenges -> Database development and training material
  
  * [SOYGEN](https://ncsrp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/NCSRP-2021-Genetic-Gain.pdf): Science Optimized Yield Gains across ENvironments
  * SOYGEN using the NUST past and present data - again available on both [SoyBase.org](SoyBase.og) and [SoybeanBase] (https://soybeanbase.breedinginsight.net). 
  * Data from NUST is publicly available and the phenotypic data is available on [SoyBase](https://soybase.org/ncsrp/queryportal/)
  * More info about the NUST can be found [here](https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUSERFILES/50200500/NUST/2020%20NUST.PDF)

4. Katy Martin Rainey: Genetic Improvement of Complex Traits in Soybean: Insights into Selection for Yield, Maturity and Seed Quality

  * Using the well documented public #soybean resources at [SoyBase.org](SoyBase.org) including the SoySNP50K and SoyNAM.
  * Impact of increased sucrose content on overall seed quality in soybean Increasing sucrose content would likely lead to protein content sacrifices. Paper in review/No pre-print.

5. Yong-Qiang (Charles) An:  Toward Understanding Molecular Basis of Seed Protein and Oil in Soybean Domestication and Improvement through an Integrative Data Driven Approach

  * Introgression and/or improvements combination to increase desired traits. Embracing the BigData and integrative approach for breeding (alleles, functional markers, Germplasm) Focusing on soybean germplasm diversity
  * Multiple studies still finding seed quality QTLs: 
  1. POWR1 (Protein, Oil, Weight, Regulator 1) is a domestication gene pleiotropically regulating seed quality and yield in soybean [Research paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-30314-7)
  2. Fine mapping and cloning of the major seed protein quantitative trait loci on soybean chromosome 20 [Research paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34978122/)
